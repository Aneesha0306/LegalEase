THE HONBLE SRI JUSTICE V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN AND THE HONBLE SMT JUSTICE ANIS WRIT PETITION No. 29205 of 2016 ORDER: (Per VRS,J) The petitioner, who participated in the selection for admission to a Super Speciality Course in Medicine, namely, M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) and who secured the first rank, has come up with the above writ petition, seeking a Mandamus to declare the action of the respondents in treating all the three seats available for admission only to local candidates and not throwing open even one of those seats for un-reserved categories. Heard Mr. Chintala Sumon Reddy, learned counsel for the petitioner, Mr. Taddi Nageswara Rao, learned standing counsel for Dr. N.T.R. University of Health Sciences, appearing for the 1st respondent, and the learned Additional Advocate General representing Mr. A. Prabhakar Rao, learned standing counsel for the 2nd respondent University. There is no dispute about the fact that the petitioner is qualified to seek admission to a Super Speciality Course, which is described in common parlance as a second post-graduate course, in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology). There is also no dispute about the fact that the petitioner secured the first rank in the entrance examination. As per the seat matrix released by the 1st respondent University, which was responsible for conducting the common entrance test, for admission to all Super Speciality Medical Courses, there was only one seat in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) in the combined State of Andhra Pradesh. That seat was available in Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad. But, after the bifurcation of the State with effect from 02.06.2014, the State of Telangana increased the seats available in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) to three. In other words, the infrastructure for two additional seats, were provided by the state of Telangana, and the Medical Council of India has also permitted the increase in the number of seats from one to three, insofar as M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) is concerned. After the conduct of the common entrance examination by the 1st respondent University, the 2nd respondent University appears to have released a selection chart for admission to all M.Ch. courses in the State of Telangana for the academic year 2016-2017. As per the said selection chart, the 2nd respondent University has divided the three seats available in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) into two categories. These two categories are (i) one seat that was in existence before the bifurcation of the State as a non-State-wide seat, and (ii) two seats allegedly created as State-wide seats after the bifurcation of the State. On the basis of the said logic, the 2nd respondent University has allotted all the three seats, to the local area of Osmania University. The consequence is that the petitioner, who is not treated as a local candidate in Osmania University area, will not get admission to M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology), despite having secured the first rank in the entrance examination. Therefore, questioning the action of the 2nd respondent University, the petitioner is before this Court. In order to test the correctness of the segregation of the three seats by the 2nd respondent University into non-State-wide seats and State-wide seats, it is necessary to take note of the relevant provisions of the Presidential Order and the relevant provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014. In exercise of the powers conferred by clauses (1) and (2) of Article 371-D of the Constitution, the President issued an order known as Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions (Regulation of Admissions) Order, 1974. There are certain definitions provided in Paragraph-2 of the Presidential Order. The expression available seats is defined in Paragraph-2(a) of the Presidential Order, to mean, in relation to any course of study, the number of seats provided in that course for admission at any time after excluding those reserved for candidates from outside the State. The expression State-wide University is defined in Paragraph-2(f) to indicate the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University, the Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, and the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences. Similarly, the expression State-wide educational institution is defined in Paragraph-2(e), to mean, an educational institution or a Department of an educational institution specified in the Schedule to the Presidential Order. The reason as to why the Presidential Order seeks to distinguish State-wide University and State-wide educational institution from non-State-wide University and non-State-wide educational institution, is that both are governed by different paragraphs of the Presidential order. This can be seen from a close look at Paragraphs-5 and 6 of the Presidential Order. Paragraph-5(1) of the Presidential Order mandates that admission to 85% of the available seats in every course of study provided by the Andhra University, Nagarjuna University, Osmania University, Kakatiya University or Sri Venkateswara University or by any educational institution other than a State-wide University or a State-wide educational institution, shall be reserved in favour of the local candidates, in relation to the local area, in respect of such University or educational Institution. But, Paragraph-6(1) stipulates that admission to 85% of the available seats in every course of study provided by a State-wide University or a State-wide educational institution, shall be allotted in the ratio of 42:36:22, in relation to the local areas specified in sub-paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of Paragraph-3. To put it in simple terms, Paragraph-5 applies to non-State-wide Universities and non-State-wide educational institutions and Paragraph-6 applies to State-wide Universities and State-wide educational institutions. We have already taken note of the fact that State-wide University means, either the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University or Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University or the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences. Coming to what are State-wide educational institutions, one must seek a reference to the Schedule to the Presidential Order. The Schedule to the Presidential Order contains 15 items. The institutions, named in Serial Nos. 1 to 14, are of no relevance to the case on hand. But, Serial No.15 in the Schedule to the Presidential Order contains a list of about eight courses, in Super Specialities in Medicine, which are indicated as State-wide educational institutions. M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) is not included as one of those eight items, under Serial No.15 of the Schedule to the Presidential Order. Therefore, it is clear that the course, to which the petitioner is seeking admission, is not a State-wide educational institution, within the meaning of Paragraph-2(e) read with the Schedule to the Presidential Order. The University, namely, Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences, the 2nd respondent herein, is also not included within the definition of the expression of State-wide University under Paragraph-2(f). Therefore, it is clear that the petitioner is not seeking admission either to a State-wide University or to a State-wide educational institution. Once this is clear, then it follows, as a corollary that what would govern the admission to the present course, is only the provisions of Paragraph-5 of the Presidential Order. Paragraph-5 of the Presidential Order reads as follows: 5. Reservation in non-State-wide Universities and educational institutions:- (1) Admission to eighty-five percent of the available seats in every course of study provided by the Andhra University, the Nagarjuna university, the Osmania University, the Kakatiya university or Sri Venkateswara University or by any educational institution (other than a State-wide University or a State-wide Educational Institution) which is subject to the control of the State Government shall be reserved in favour of the local candidates in relation to the local area in respect of such University or other educational institution. (2) While determining under sub-paragraph(1) the number of seats to be reserved in favour of local candidates any fraction of a seat shall be counted as one: Provided that there shall be at least one unreserved seat. As we have pointed out earlier, sub-paragraph (1) of Paragraph-5 provides for a reservation of 85% of the available seats in every course of study, to local candidates. Sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5 stipulates that while determining the number of seats to be reserved in favour of local candidates, any fraction of a seat should be counted as one. However, the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) are circumscribed by the proviso thereunder, which stipulates that at least one seat should be an un-reserved seat. If we apply the prescriptions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Paragraph-5, to the case on hand, it could be seen that the total number of seats available in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) are three. If 85% of those seats are to be reserved for local candidates, the number of seats that the local candidates would get, would be 2.55. As per sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5, any fraction should be rounded off to one. Therefore, if sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Paragraph-5 alone are counted, the number of seats to be reserved for local candidates would be three. But, the same is circumscribed by the proviso, which states that at least one seat should be an un-reserved seat. The proviso to sub-paragraph (2) is actually restrictive in nature and it curtails the reach of sub-paragraph (2) to a limited extent. In other words, the fall out of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) of Paragraph-5 together with the proviso thereunder, would be that one out of those three seats should be kept as an un-reserved seat and the remaining two seats should go to the local candidates. At this juncture, it is also necessary to take note of one distinction between Paragraph-5 and Paragraph-6 of the Presidential Order. While Paragraph-5 (1) prescribes a percentage of reservation for local candidates, Paragraph-6 (1) speaks about the distribution of those reserved vacancies, among the local areas carved out in relation to that particular region. The proviso to sub-paragraph (1) of Paragraph-6 makes the distribution provided in sub-paragraph (1) applicable only to cases where the total number of seats exceeds three. We have taken note of the distinction between Paragraph-5 and Paragraph-6, only to drive home the point that both operate at different levels, and that Paragraph-6 does not have any application to the case on hand, in view of the distinction between (i) State-wide Universities and non-State-wide Universities and (ii) State-wide educational institutions and non-State-wide educational institutions. The result of the above discussion is that, as per the proviso to sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5, one out of three seats available for M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) should be kept as an un-reserved seat. If one seat is un-reserved, the person, who has secured the highest rank, would naturally get it. Therefore, the petitioner has come up with the above writ petition. But, it is contended by the learned Additional Advocate General appearing on behalf of the 2nd respondent University that the prescriptions contained in Paragraph-5 of the Presidential Order would apply only to the number of seats available as on the date of the bifurcation of the State, and that the seats created by the respective States after the bifurcation, would go only to the students of that State and cannot be thrown open for being filled up, simply on the basis of merit. In support of this contention, the learned Additional Advocate General sought to draw our attention to the difference between the language used in Article 371-D before the bifurcation and the language used in the Article after the bifurcation. The learned Additional Advocate General also invited our attention to Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014. It is true that in Article 371-D, as it existed prior to 02.06.2014, there was a reference only to the State of Andhra Pradesh. But, by the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, the words State of Andhra Pradesh were substituted by the words the State of Andhra Pradesh or the State of Telangana. Therefore, the contention of the learned Additional Advocate General is that after the bifurcation of the State, the entire Presidential Order will have to be applied independently to each of the two States, and that there is no question of applying the provisions of the Presidential Order to a combined State, as if both States exist together even as on date. Theoretically, the learned Additional Advocate General may be right in saying that after two States are formed, the provisions of Article 371-D may have to be applied independently to each of the two States. But unfortunately for the 2nd respondent University, the key to the problem is to be found in Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014. Section 95 reads as follows: Equal opportunities for quality higher education to all students:- In order to ensure equal opportunities for quality higher education to all students in the successor States, the existing admission quotas in all Government or private, aided or unaided, institutions of higher, technical and medical education insofar as it is provided under Article 371-D of the Constitution, shall continue as such for a period of ten years during which the existing common admission process shall continue. A careful look at Section 95 would show that both the Governments are obliged to maintain the existing admission quotas in all Government, private, aided or unaided institutions, as provided in Article 371-D of the Constitution, for a period of 10 years, during which the existing common admission process is to continue. The words and phrases, that are of significance in Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, are (i) all students in the successor States, (ii) the existing admission quotas, (iii) shall continue as such, and (iv) the existing common admission process. If all the above words and phrases are carefully looked at, it could be clear that what is expected to continue for 10 years by Section 95 is the existing quota under the existing common admission process. These words assume significance, in the light of the fact that the words used in Paragraph-5(1) of the Presidential order are available seats. Section 95 does not use the expression available seats. The emphasis in Section 95 is not on the seats, but on the existing quota. In other words, what is sought to be preserved is the quota and not the number of seats. The result is that if any one or more of the two States increases the number of seats, the benefit of such increase should be made available for a period of 10 years under Section 95, to a common admission process with the application of the existing quota, namely, 85% for locals or 85% for locals with a distribution pattern of 42:36:22. The learned Additional Advocate General sought to give a different interpretation to the expression existing quota, by relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court in State Bank of India Vs. Yogendra Kumar Srivastava and others. In the said case, the question that arose before the Supreme Court was whether the expression existing officers would include probationary and trainee officers or not. The Supreme Court held that having regard to the broad framework of the policy framed by the State Bank of India, the probationary and trainee officers are not to be counted as existing officers. Placing reliance upon the said judgment, it was contended by the learned Additional Advocate General that the expression existing quota appearing in Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, should be understood, only to mean the existing seats as on the date of the bifurcation. But, we do not agree. The most fundamental rule of interpretation of statutes is that the Courts are not entitled either to add or substitute or replace the words that are found in the statute. If Section 95 had been worded in such a way as to put a freeze on the total number of seats to which the existing quota would apply, then it would have been a different matter. So long as the Parliament did not think fit either to use the expression existing seats or the expression available seats as found in Paragraph-5(1) of the Presidential Order or as defined in Paragraph-2(a) of the Presidential Order, it is not open to this Court to interpret the expression existing admission quotas to mean the existing seats. The casus omissus cannot be supplied by a Court to a statute. Therefore, by the plain language of Section 95, it is clear that even after the bifurcation, the Parliament thought fit to preserve two things, namely, (i) the existing common admission process, and (ii) existing admission quotas for a period of ten years. It may be a different matter after the expiry of the period of ten years. But, till then, what is sought to be preserved is the quota and the admission process, and not the total number of seats. The next contention of the learned Additional Advocate General is that after the State of Telangana had created additional seats and provided necessary infrastructure for the additional seats, at the cost of the exchequer, it may not be fair to throw those seats open to outsiders. But, such a contention is more emotional than legal and we cannot be called upon to decide any issue on any parameter which is not constitutional. As a matter of fact, the total number of seats for M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) before the bifurcation of the State was only one. If no additional seats had been created, that seat would be available only to the local candidate. This is by virtue of the full Bench decision of this Court in Dr. B. Sudhakar, M.D., Vs. Union of India, rep. by the Secretary to Govt., Ministry of Home Affairs, Govt. of India, New Delhi and others. In that case, before the Full Bench, an argument was advanced that the proviso to sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5, would make it incumbent upon the State to throw open a seat to the un-reserved category, if there was only one seat available in a particular course. While rejecting the said argument in Paragraph-32 of its decision, the Full Bench pointed out that though a proviso can curtail the reach of the substantive Section, it cannot destroy the very purpose of the substantive part of the statute. Interestingly, after having held so, the Full Bench of this Court also provided a Tabular column with respect to the application of the existing quota to various students, when the number of seats available in a course varied from one to twenty. The Table provided by the Full Bench of this Court in Dr. B. Sudhakar (2 supra) in Paragraph-25 of its judgment may be usefully extracted as follows: (Table omitted for brevity). It can be seen from the Table provided by the Full Bench in its decision in Dr. B. Sudhakar that when there were only three seats available in a particular course, all the three seats would go to local area, if sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5 alone was applied. But, on the right side extreme column of the Table, the Full Bench indicated the effect of the proviso, when there were three seats available. The effect was that out of those three seats, two will be kept as reserved and one as un-reserved. The above Table squarely answers the contentions of the learned Additional Advocate General. In other words, what was available to the local candidates in the State of Telangana in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) before the bifurcation was only one seat. What is now available are two seats. Since they have created two additional seats and the number of seats has gone up to three, the proviso to sub-paragraph (2) of Paragraph-5 automatically comes into play, the effect of which is not nullified by Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, but preserved by Section 95. In view of the above, the Writ Petition is allowed, directing the respondents to treat one out of the three seats in M.CH. (Surgical Oncology), as an un-reserved seat, to be available for the most meritorious candidate and fill up the said seat with the most meritorious candidate who has secured the first rank. Consequently, miscellaneous petitions if any pending in the writ petitions shall stand dismissed. No order as to costs. _________________________ V. RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J ____________________ ANIS, J. 30th August, 2016","This is a High Court judgment concerning medical admissions after the division of the State of Andhra Pradesh. The petitioner, Dr. Phanindra Kumar Nagisetty, secured the first rank in the entrance exam for the M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) Super Speciality Course. The Core Issue: Who Gets the Seats? The problem arose because the college had three seats available for the course. The 2nd Respondent University (Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences) decided to treat all three seats as reserved only for local candidates of the Osmania University area (Telangana). Dr. Nagisetty challenged this, arguing that despite the bifurcation of the state and the creation of new seats, at least one seat must be kept ""un-reserved"" and open to the most meritorious candidate, regardless of their local status. Since he was Rank 1, he should get this seat. The Court's Decision and Reasoning The Court examined the relevant laws, specifically the Presidential Order (Article 371-D) and Section 95 of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act, 2014, which governed the division of the state: The Presidential Order Rule: Under Paragraph 5 of the Presidential Order, which applies to this course, 85% of seats are reserved for locals. Critically, the rule includes a ""proviso"" (a small but mandatory rule) stating that ""there shall be at least one un-reserved seat."" Applying the Rule: With three seats available, reserving 85% means 2.55 seats for locals. When rounded up, this means 3 seats. However, the proviso overrides this, forcing the University to set aside one seat as un-reserved. This leaves two seats for local candidates. The New State Argument (and why it failed): The University argued that the two new seats created by the Telangana state after the bifurcation should automatically go to Telangana students. The Court rejected this. It cited Section 95 of the Reorganization Act, which mandates that the ""existing admission quotas"" must continue for 10 years using the common admission process. This means the rules (like the ""at least one un-reserved seat"" rule) must be applied to the new, increased total of three seats. The Final Order The High Court allowed the Writ Petition. The respondents were directed to treat one out of the three seats in M.Ch. (Surgical Oncology) as an un-reserved seat. They must fill this un-reserved seat with Dr. Phanindra Kumar Nagisetty, as he is the most meritorious candidate (Rank 1)."

"Delhi High Court Rishi Dev @ Onkar Singh vs State (Delhi Admn.) on 1 May, 2008 Author: S. Muralidhar Bench: S. Muralidhar JUDGMENT S. Muralidhar, J. 1. This appeal is directed against the judgment and order dated 25th November, 2000 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ), Delhi in S.C. 10 of 2000 convicting the appellant in FIR No. 290/90 for the offence under Section 21 of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 (NDPS Act) for possessing 300 gm smack. It is also directed against the order dated 27th November, 2000 passed by the learned ASJ sentencing the Appellant to ten years rigorous imprisonment (RI) and a fine of Rs. 1,00,000 under Section 21 NDPS Act and in default of payment of fine to undergo six months RI. 2. The case of the prosecution is that on 19th December, 1999 Head Constable (HC) Rajinder Singh, Constables Sarvjeet, Ashok Kumar and Ajit Singh were searching the passersby near Tejab Mill, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara. At about 3.35 p.m. one person (the appellant) came from the side of the Railway Bridge, Subji Mandi, Shahdara and on seeing the police, the appellant stated to have turned around and started walking briskly. Upon being asked to stop, the appellant started running. His apprehension and search led to the recovery of one black coloured packet from the right side pocket of the kurta worn by him. Inside the said packet was a smaller white coloured packet which contained a brown coloured powder which was suspected to be smack. It is stated that the HC Rajinder Singh then sent an intimation to the Police Station Farash Bazar about the recovery. Sub Inspector (SI) B.D. Sharma reached the spot and HC Rajinder Singh handed over to SI the accused as well as the recovered substance. In the meantime, the SHO Farash Bazar also reached there and the SI produced before him the recovered smack. According to the prosecution, the smack was weighed at the spot and was found to be 300 gm out of which a sample of 50 gms was separated. The CFSL Form was filled up and both the pulandas and CFSL Form were sealed by the IO and SHO with their respective seals. A sample packet was then sent to the CFSL for testing. A report was received from the CFSL which stated that the sample tested positive for smack. 3. Nine witnesses were examined for the prosecution and none was examined for the accused. 4. The learned ASJ thereafter delivered the impugned judgment and order. 5. The submissions of Mr. Anish Dhingra, the learned Counsel, appearing for the Appellant are as under: (a) The mandatory notice under Section 50 NDPS Act was not given to the Appellant. (b) There was no evidence to show that the police had with it any field kit or weighing machine to actually weigh the exact quantity. (c) The seal of the SHO was given to the Constable which was impermissible. (d) No independent witness was present despite the arrest being in a crowded area. (e) The documents contained the FIR number even before registration. (f) The arrest memo bore a signature of a neighbour of the accused though arrest occurred elsewhere. (g) There was over two months delay in sending the sample to CFSL. (h) The FSL report showed the sample was received late. (i) There were inconsistencies with road certificates and seals. 6. The learned APP argued that Section 50 compliance was not mandatory, and delay or absence of public witnesses was not fatal as per case law. 7. The Court first considered the delay in sending the sample for testing — nearly three months. 8–9. The Court cited Parminder Singh v. State of Haryana and Matloob v. State (Delhi Admn.) which emphasized that samples must be sent within 72 hours to prevent tampering. 10–13. Reviewing witness testimonies, the Court found inconsistencies in the custody and handling of the seized sample. 14–16. The Supreme Court precedents (Valsala v. State of Kerala, State of Gujarat v. Ismail U Haji Patel, State of Orissa v. Kanduri Sahu) held that delay is not fatal if safe custody is proved—but here, the prosecution failed to show proper custody. 17–23. The Court found that no explanation existed for the 3-month delay and that the sample’s integrity was doubtful. The trial court’s casual approach was criticized. 24–25. The conviction was set aside, the accused acquitted, and ordered to be released immediately.","This document is the judgment from the Delhi High Court on an appeal filed by Rishi Dev (also known as Onkar Singh), who was convicted under the NDPS Act (Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) for possessing 300 grams of smack (heroin). The lower court had sentenced him to 10 years in jail and a fine of ?1,00,000. The police claimed they found a black packet containing 300 grams of brown powder (smack) on Rishi Dev in Shahdara on December 19, 1999. They sent a sample for forensic testing, which confirmed it was smack, and based on this, the trial court found him guilty. The High Court, however, focused on a critical issue: a nearly three-month delay in sending the seized sample to the forensic lab. The rules require samples to be sent promptly (within about 72 hours) to ensure there is no tampering, and the prosecution must prove the sample was safely kept during any delay. In this case, the police gave no valid explanation for the delay, and the records showed inconsistencies and poor handling of evidence. The High Court ruled that this failure created serious doubt about whether the tested sample was the same one seized from the accused. As a result, the Court overturned the conviction, acquitted Rishi Dev of all charges under the NDPS Act, and ordered his immediate release."

JUSTICE R.N.MANJULA W.P Nos.2902 & 29916 of 2018 A.Selvam Anandaraj, Upper Division Clerk (Retired) Puducherry Municipality, No.4, Drowbathi Street, Kennendy Garden, Sami Pillaithottam, Lawspet, Puducherry-8. ... Petitioner in WP.2902/2018 V.Kuppusamy, Upper Division Clerk (Retired) Puducherry Municipality, No.19/A, Antoniar Koil Street, Muthialpet, Puducherry-3 ... Petitioner in WP.29916/2018 /vs/ 1) The Commissioner, Puducherry Municipality, Puducherry 605 001. 2) The Director, Local Administration Department, Puducherry 605 001. ... Respondents in both WPs. Writ Petitions are filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to promote notionally the petitioners to the post of Assistant with effect from 22.12.2006. The date on which the Octrori Barrier Operators were promoted and to pass such further or other orders as may be deemed fit and proper in the circumstances of the case. In both WPs., For Petitioner : Mr.P.Suresh For Respondents : Mr.M.Nirmalkumar, Government Advocate (Pondicherry) COMMON ORDER These Writ Petitions have been filed seeking a writ of mandamus to direct the respondents to grant notional promotion to the petitioners to the post of Assistant with effect from 22.12.2006 from the date on which Octroi Barrier Operators were promoted. 2.Heard Mr.P.Suresh, learned counsel for the petitioner, and Mr.M.Nirmalkumar, learned Government Advocate (Pondicherry) for the respondents and perused the materials available on record. 3. The petitioners who were joined as clerks on a daily wages basis with effect from 16.03.1987 have been absorbed into the regular establishment in the post of junior assistant on 20.04.1990. The petitioners were given with an upgradation under the Assured Career Progression Scheme in view of the delay caused for getting the promotion to the next level. The petitioners were given with an actual promotion in the post of senior assistant with effect from 22.12.2006. 4. As the petitioners were already granted with the financial upgradation, they were not given with any monetary benefit during their actual promotion. In the year 2007, the posts of junior assistant and senior assistant were re-designated as Lower Division Clerk and Upper Division Clerk respectively. 18 new posts of assistant [Group-B-Selection post] were also created, but they were not filled up. No recruitment rules for filling up the above posts were also published. The 1st respondent published the seniority list of Upper Division Clerks on 28.10.2010. 5. In the meanwhile, the persons working as 'Octroi Barrier Operators' were rendered surplus in view of the abolition of Octroi in the Union Territory of Puducherry. As they have been deployed and accommodated in the post of Lower Division Clerk, a revised seniority list was published on 07.11.2014, and thereafter the respondents filled up 18 vacant posts by promoting Octroi Barrier Operators, and they were given with a retrospective promotion to the post of Upper Division Clerk. The petitioner in W.P.No.2902/2018 retired from service on 31.07.2015, and the petitioner in WP.No.29916/2018 retired from service on 31.10.2014. The failure to initiate timely action to consider the petitioners promotion has affected them adversely. On 20.12.2006, when retrospective promotions were given to Octroi Barrier Operators, the petitioners were in constructive service, but they were not considered for promotion. 6. The learned Government Advocate (Pondicherry) for the respondents submitted that the petitioners have been promoted to the post of senior assistant only on an adhoc basis with effect from 22.12.2006. Both the petitioners were not entitled to grant the Assured Career Progression Scheme for further fixation of pay and on promotion to the senior assistant on the revised scale of pay on par with the other senior assistants. Because they did not pass the required departmental test. They failed to complete the departmental test till their retirement. Hence they were not considered for further grant of ACP or promotion to any higher post in Pondicherry Municipality. 7. The learned Government Advocate (Pondicherry) for the respondents further submitted that with regard to 18 posts created at the assistant level, for which the method of filing up of those posts, the rules of recruitment have been framed according to which 60% are by promotion, failing which by Limited Departmental Competitive Examinations and failing both by direct recruitment; 20% are by Limited Departmental Competitive Examinations, failing which by promotion, and failing both by direct recruitment; and 20% are by direct recruitment through open competition. 8. The panel containing 23 eligible candidates was placed before the Departmental Promotion Committee, which was duly constituted on 20.07.2016 for selection to the post of Assistant. After due scrutiny, the Departmental Promotion Committee recommended 22 candidates for promotion based on merit. As the petitioners had already retired, they did not come within the ambit of selection. 9. The only grievance of the petitioners is that the promotions were not done in a fixed time limit and that had caused the loss of promotional avenues to the petitioners. The petitioners were promoted in the year 2016 to the post of senior assistant. Before that they were given with the upgradation pay. So for as the next level promotion that was open to the petitioners, it was to the post of assistants. The 18 posts that had been created in the cadre of assistants were not filled up at the time when the petitioners were in service. 10. For the reasons best known to the respondents, there was a delay in recruiting/promoting persons to the post of assistants. Just because any policy decision is taken at a later point of time to expedite the promotion or to do recruitment after a person retires from service, the retired person cannot claim that they would have been given with the promotion if timely action is taken and hence the benefit should be given to them with retrospective effect. 11. Time and again the position of law on this aspect has been reiterated that no one can claim promotion as a matter of right, though it is an indispensable post if any ones career. If the promotions were given as and when due it could have been appreciated. For the reasons best known to the respondents, promotions are withheld for a very long time, and during this period, a person who attained the age of superannuation got retired from service. 12. The entire exercise cannot be done once again by presuming that the retired persons are still in service. The petitioners have approached the Court after their retirement and that too after 18 years. The petitioners did not have any explanation for justifying the delay and latches on their part. No fancy claim for promotion subsequent to retirement can be considered unless for any extraneous reasons. 13. The delay in giving promotion to the post of assistant not only affected the petitioners but also persons similar to them who had been in service during the relevant point of time. Even the petitioners had required to what was given or denied to them while they were in service. Matters which had been given a go-by if opened all of a sudden unmindful of the impractical and endless consequences, will create complex situations which may be worse than the issue at hand. The petitioners could not justify the delay and latches which directly hit their case. In the result, these writ petitions are dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. 24.02.2025 Index : Yes Internet : Yes/No Neutral: Yes/No Speaking: Non Speaking order jrs R.N.MANJULA, J. jrs To 1) The Commissioner, Puducherry Municipality, Puducherry 605 001. 2) The Director, Local Administration Department, Puducherry 605 001.","This document is a judgment delivered by the Madras High Court (Justice R.N. Manjula) on February 24, 2026, dismissing two writ petitions filed by retired employees of the Puducherry Municipality, A. Selvam Anandaraj and V. Kuppusamy. The petitioners sought a court direction to grant them notional promotion to the post of Assistant, effective retrospectively from December 22, 2006, the date when other surplus employees (Octroi Barrier Operators) were promoted. The petitioners, who had retired in 2014 and 2015, argued that the Municipality's failure to initiate timely action to fill 18 newly created Assistant posts adversely affected their career progression, especially since other employees received retrospective promotions. The respondents (Puducherry Municipality) countered that the petitioners were ineligible for further promotion because they had failed to pass the required departmental tests until their retirement. The Municipality further explained that the selection process for the Assistant posts was only completed in 2016, after the petitioners had already retired, placing them outside the pool of eligible candidates. The Court dismissed the petitions, affirming several principles of service law. The judge stated that promotion cannot be claimed as a matter of right. Crucially, the Court held that a retired person cannot claim a fancy claim for promotion subsequent to retirement with retrospective effect simply because the employer delayed the promotional exercise. The court pointed out that the petitioners were guilty of significant delay and laches, having approached the court years after their retirement and after the alleged cause of action (the delay in promotion) had occurred. The judge concluded that re-opening matters that have been given a go-by creates complex and endless situations, and since the petitioners could not justify their long delay, their writ petitions were dismissed."

(Signature) ______________________","This Loan Agreement, executed on non-judicial stamp paper in Telangana on October 28, 2025, details a personal loan transaction between Mr. Rajesh Kumar (the Lender) and Ms. Priya Sharma (the Borrower). The core of the agreement is the lending of ?5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs Only) to the Borrower. A unique and significant feature of this contract is that the Loan is to be repaid without any interest to the Lender, suggesting this is a zero-interest, goodwill, or personal arrangement. The repayment schedule mandates the loan be repaid in consecutive monthly instalments starting immediately on the date of execution, October 28, 2025, and continuing monthly until the final payment date of October 28, 2027. This sets the loan's term at exactly two years. Importantly, the Borrower retains the flexibility to make lump sum payments or repay the entire outstanding balance at any time without incurring any bonus or penalty, provided they are not currently in default. The Default clause provides the Lender with a strong remedy: if the Borrower defaults on any obligation, the Lender may immediately declare the entire principal amount owing to be due and payable. The Borrower is also made liable for all legal costs and expenses, including the Lender's complete legal fees, incurred as a result of enforcing the agreement due to the Borrower's default; these costs are immediately added to the outstanding principal. The agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Telangana, and any amendments or modifications must be made via a written instrument executed by both parties."

The Commissioner of Customs, Cochin is before us in appeals aggrieved by the common final order dated 19.11.2018 passed by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal, South Zonal Bench, Bangalore. 2. The facts in brief are thus: On 04.02.2014, two persons named Surendra Singh and Dhiraj Kumar Devasi alleged to be the employees of M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd., Mumbai, were intercepted by the officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) at Vyttila in Ernakulam; from whose possession were seized gold bars and pieces weighing 4430.730 gms., valued at Rs.1,54,28,372/- and gold ornaments weighing 5536.200 gms. valued at Rs.1,32,78,898/-. That apart, Rs.42,000/- in cash, alleged to be sale proceeds of contraband gold, was also recovered. The confession statements of the apprehended persons revealed involvement of one Om Prakash Khatri, Director of M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd. Show cause notices were issued to the aforesaid three persons and the company, and after adjudication, the Joint Commissioner as per Annexure A order dated 05.05.2015 ordered absolute confiscation of the gold bars and jewellery under Section 111(a), (d) and (m) read with Section 120(1) of the Customs Act, 1962 (for short ""the Act"") and also imposed a penalty of Rs.20 lakhs on Om Prakash Khatri and Rs.10 lakhs on M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd. under Section 114AA of the Act. The Adjudicating Authority also imposed a penalty of Rs.5 lakhs each on the aforementioned three persons as well as the Company under Section 112 of the Act. The currency was however ordered to be released. 3. The appeals filed before the Commissioner was disposed of vide a common order at Annexure B dated 08.10.2015 modifying the order of the Adjudicating Authority by quashing the confiscation of gold ornaments. The remaining part of the order was sustained. The parties again filed a second appeal before the Tribunal, which vide common impugned order allowed the appeal and set aside the adjudicatory order altogether. 4. The Revenue is aggrieved and hence the appeal, raising the following substantial questions of law, as re-framed by us: i) Was the Tribunal justified in finding that the Department has failed to establish that the seized gold were smuggled goods ? ii) Was the Tribunal justified in quashing the entire order of confiscation ? 5. We heard Sri.Thomas Mathew Nellimoottil, Senior Standing Counsel for the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs appearing for the appellant and Sri.B.R.Tripathi, learned Counsel appearing for the respondents. 6. The Tribunal has, in the impugned order, found that the burden on the Department, to prove that the gold bars and jewellery seized from the two persons apprehended at Vyttila were smuggled gold; was not discharged. It is pointed out that under Section 123 of the Act, the burden was entirely on the Department to prove that the seized gold was smuggled. It is observed that the gold bars were not of standard size, shape or weight and that there were no markings on it. The ornaments were of 91.6% purity and therefore, cannot be assumed to have been imported; which finding we immediately notice was irrelevant insofar as the first appellate authority having released the ornaments. It is also observed that the two persons apprehended were not coming out of any Airport or Seaport, nor were they crossing any international border so as to warrant action under Section 110 of the Customs Act. It is also observed that the Adjudicating Authority and the first appellate authority came to a wrong conclusion relying on the statements of the two salesmen, which was subsequently retracted. 7. Reliance was placed on the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Collector of Customs, Madras v. D.Bhoormall, 1983 (13) ELT 1546 (SC) and in Collector of Customs (Preveventive) v. Shri Ganesh Enterprises, 2006 (199) ELT 208 (Bom) by the Tribunal to hold that the Department had the burden to prove that the contraband gold had entered the Country illegally and were smuggled. The Tribunal also found fault with the Department for not having examined the twelve persons from whom the respondents had been purchasing gold for the purpose of making ornaments. It is also pointed out that no customs duty has been demanded by the Department from the persons apprehended and there was absolutely no material on the basis of which the Department could have reasonably believed that the goods were smuggled, and therefore, the adjudicating as well as appellate authority's orders were quashed. 8. It is seen that the statements of the two salesmen of the Company were recorded under Section 108 of the Act by the DRI. Wherein, they had stated that they collected gold bars and pieces smuggled into India from Kerala and took the same to Mumbai to be handed over to Om Prakash Khatri, who is one of the Directors of M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd. It is stated by them that an associate of Om Prakash Khatri at Thiruvananthapruam handed over the gold to them. They also admitted having collected gold from Kerala on earlier occasions for being handed over to Khatri. Ornaments were made out of smuggled gold and sold at a very competitive price. The salesmen revealed that they did not travel by flights for the reason that there was security checking and customs checking at the Airport. 5 kgs. of gold ornaments were given to them to be sold in Kerala, without any document or bill. They also admitted that Khatri had cautioned about the possibility of being intercepted by the Police or the Customs, as the ornaments were made out of smuggled gold. They reached Thiruvananthapuram and met a Keralite, described as a fat and dark person, who handed over the gold bars and pieces. It is also stated by them that the markings in the gold had been removed so as to conceal the identity of the smuggled gold and that the gold was also cut into small pieces and melted. They came to Ernakulam by bus and were intending to sell the ornaments and jewellery in and around Ernakulam as also take back the smuggled gold. But they were intercepted while alighting from a bus at Vyttila, and apprehended by the DRI officials, resulting in the contraband gold being seized. 9. Summons were issued to Khatri and on 06.02.2014, the representative of the Company handed over certain documents, including copies of gold ornaments stock register, refined gold register; along with a covering letter purportedly that of Khatri, but not signed by him, which expressed his inability to appear in person before the DRI. Another summons was issued to him on 07.02.2014, to which also he did not respond. Thereafter, he filed an application for anticipatory bail before the Sessions Court, Ernakulam, which got dismissed. He thereafter approached this Court, and the application was disposed of with a direction asking him to surrender before the DRI on 12.03.2014, to produce all documents and also to co- operate with the investigation. 10. Follow up investigation was also conducted by the DRI at Mumbai and the search revealed that the premises of M/s Panna Gold had another company by name ""Om Jewellers"", operating in the premises, of which Khatri was the Proprietor. 3790 gms. of gold was seized, but later released, since it was not connected with the seizure at Ernakulam. 11. Khatri's statements were recorded by the DRI on 12.03.2014, 24.03.2014 and 25.03.2014. He also produced certain documents. He was thereafter arrested on 25.03.2014 and produced before the Addl. CJM (Economic Offences), Ernakulam. The Adjudicating Authority found that there was no document to prove the legitimacy of the gold recovered from the two salesmen of M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd. and in the statements given by them under Section 108 they admitted that the gold handed over to them was smuggled gold and the ornaments seized were made of such smuggled gold. No reliable documentary proof was also produced by the company to prove that they had purchased the gold legally, and therefore, the Adjudicatory Authority ordered confiscation of gold bars and ornaments and also imposed the penalty as stated above. In first appeal, the ornaments were ordered to be released, but the confiscation of gold bars and pieces confirmed. 12. Coming to the finding of the Tribunal regarding the burden of proof, it would be necessary to examine the scope of Section 123 of the Act, which deals with burden of proof in certain cases. Section 123(2) in particular, is pertinent, which reads thus: ""123. Burden of proof in certain cases.- (1) When any goods to which this section applies are seized under this Act in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods, the burden of proving that they are not smuggled goods shall be- (a)in a case where the seizure is from the possession of any person,- (i)on the person from whose possession the goods were seized, and (ii)..... (b).......... (2) This section shall apply to gold and manufactures thereof, watches and any other class or good which the Central Government may by notification in the Official Gazette, specify."" From a reading of the section, it is explicit that, when any goods to which the Section applies are seized under the Act under the reasonable belief that they were smuggled goods, the burden of proof as to they were not smuggled goods, shall be on the person from whose possession the goods were seized. As far as gold and watches are concerned, the Section applies directly, and regarding other goods, the Central Government may by notification in the official gazette specify. Hence, the finding of the Tribunal that the burden is on the Department to prove that the gold was smuggled, cannot be accepted. The Tribunal has relied on the decision on D.Bhoormall (supra) to justify that the burden is on the Department. A reading of paragraph 34 of the judgment would be pertinent, where, it is stated that it would be enough, if the Department furnishes prima facie proof of the goods being smuggled stock. A reading of Section 123 also require only a reasonable belief as far as gold is concerned, that it was smuggled. The gold was recovered from the possession of the two individuals intercepted by the DRI, who were not able to give a satisfactory explanation to upset the reasonable belief entertained by the DRI officials who recovered huge quantity of unmarked gold from the persons intercepted. In fact the statements made by the intercepted individuals further fortified the belief entertained by the officials. The statement of the carriers of the gold under Section 108 of the Act, can be safely relied upon by the Department to proceed against them. The decision in Shri Ganesh Enterprises (supra) relied on by the Tribunal is not applicable to the case, because the said decision deals with confiscation of non-notified goods and not gold or other notified goods. 13. The learned Counsel for the Department relies on the decision in Labhchand Dhanpat Singh Jain v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1975 SC 182, wherein the Hon'ble Supreme held as follows: ""9. xx xx xx The appellant admitted, in his statement under Section 108 of the Act that H transporting of these pieces of gold was an offence. If the gold had been legally imported before 1948 it could not be an offence to carry it. The appellant had not proved who Pannalal, the person who was alleged by him to have given him the gold to carry, was. Atleast, the burden of proving an innocent receipt of gold lay upon the appellant under Section 106 Evidence Act. The totality of facts proved was enough, in our opinion, to raise a presumption under Section 114 Evidence Act that the gold had been illegally imported into the country so as to be covered by Section 111(d) of the Act. The appellant had not offered any other reasonable explanation of the manner in which it was being carried."" 14. In the aforesaid decision, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the appellant in that case was fully aware of the allegations made against him, and had given an inculpatory statement under Section 108 of the Act regarding the circumstances in which he was arrested with the gold bars. 15. In Sailash Amulakh Jogani v. Union of India, 2009 (241) ELT 348 (Bom) relied on by the learned Counsel for the Department, the goods involved were diamonds, which were not notified under Section 123 of the Act and it was held that in view of the fact that there was no notification, the onus of proving the diamonds are of foreign origin and are smuggled to India was on the Department. It was, however, held that the burden on the Department is very slight and since the diamonds were not covered by vouchers, the circumstance was sufficient to substantiate the case of the Department that those diamonds were smuggled. 16. In Shah Guman Mal v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1983 (13) ELT 1631 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the Department cannot press into service the presumption arising from Section 123 of the Act, since there was no seizure made under Section 111 of the Act; which is not applicable in the facts of this case. 17. Per contra, Sri.B.R.Tripathi, the learned Counsel appearing for the respondents, submits that there were no foreign markings on the gold and therefore no presumption, whatsoever, could have been drawn regarding the seized gold being smuggled. The onus on the authority to establish that the articles were smuggled was not discharged and the Tribunal was justified in holding that there was no proof in favour of the Department against the carriers so as to proceed against them. 18. We have considered the decisions relied on by both sides and are of the opinion that in case of seizure of gold, even without markings, the burden is upon the person, who has custody of the gold, under Section 123 of the Act, to prove that the gold was legally acquired. The statement recorded under Section 108 of the Act could be safely relied upon in the proceedings against respondents. In K.I.Pavunny v. Assistant Collector, (1997) 3 SCC 721 the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a person summoned under Section 108 of the Act is ""not the person accused of an offence"" for the purpose of Section 24 of the Evidence Act. The primary question for consideration in that case was whether the retracted confession statement of the appellant is inadmissible in evidence under Section 24 of the Evidence Act. It is observed that even though the customs officers have been invested with many of the powers, which an officer-in-charge of a police station exercises, while investigating a congnizable offence, they do not, thereby become police officers within the meaning of Section 25 of the Evidence Act and so the confessional statement by the accused persons to customs officials would be admissible in evidence against them and it was ultimately held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the prosecution has proved the case based on the confession of the appellant given in Ext.P4 under Section 108 of the Evidence Act. 19. The unmarked gold recovered from the possession of two persons and their statements as to the source of the gold was sufficient to have a reasonable belief that the gold is smuggled. The two persons who were carrying the gold had nothing in their possession to prove the legitimacy of the gold they carried. The fact that the gold bars and pieces did not have any marking on them is suspicious and it points to a concerted effort to erase the markings on them. The burden under Section 123 which is only of a reasonable belief; is effectively discharged by the Department who initiated action on the basis of the seizure and the recorded statements of the detained persons. The mere fact that the interception and seizure was not affected in an international border or near an airport or seaport is irrelevant, since the statements of the intercepted persons clearly indicate that they were asked to avoid such means of transport and stick to the normal modes of public transport. There can also be no presumption drawn that the carriers of smuggled gold after the gold reaches the country would only resort to commutation by air or sea. The persons from whom the gold was seized disowned the same and said that they were mere carriers of Om Prakash Khatri, who accepted that the gold seized belonged to his Company. Then the onus to prove that the gold was not smuggled, so as to upset the reasonable belief entertained by the Department shifted and squarely rested on his shoulders. The gold bars and pieces were subjected to chemical examination which revealed that they were of 99.8% purity. The Tribunal ignored this aspect and referred to the purity of the ornaments; which was not an issue before it. 20. There was a Travel Authorisation Voucher, produced subsequently, before the DRI indicating one of the persons detained having been authorised to carry 4002.33 grams of gold, belonging to Penna Gold Impex; but the actual gold seized was 4430.730 grams. An explanation was offered as to the gold seized included gold released from Nagercovil Court out of which certain ornaments were also made. However the quantity of the gold stated to be handed over by the Company and that released from a Court, as initially stated, further changed in the retraction and later asserted in the reply to the show-cause notice, did not tally. In explaining the exact quantity of the gold as available in the voucher it was also admitted that certain vouchers were subsequently prepared with an earlier date. The signature of the carrier in the Voucher also did not tally with that in his statement recorded and the admitted ones in his PAN card, driving license, passport etc. Apart from the fact that the vouchers were not carried with the gold and was not shown to the intercepting officials; there is also no explanation as to how the quantity of gold released from the Nagercovil Court was disclosed in the Voucher, since it was not handed over at Mumbai, where the gold was asserted to have been handed over. The location details of the mobile of the carrier was found to be in Trivandrum when he is said to have visited Mumbai, to receive the gold. There was also no documents filed under the sales tax laws for the inter-state transfer of gold and ornaments. 21. The assertion was that the gold found on the two employees were that purchased by the Company at Mumbai; which details are available in the registers maintained by the Company. The stock of refined gold and gold ornaments as seen from the stock register produced at the time of investigation substantially varied from the abstracts of the stock registers produced before this Court, where Om Prakash Khatri approached for anticipatory bail. The explanation offered for the anomalies was that some gold possessed by sales men were not accounted for. This clearly belies the veracity of the registers produced in the course of investigation. Further the specific statement in the reply was that the gold seized were purchased from 12 authorised bullion dealers in Mumbai. On examination of the records produced, the adjudicating authority found that the gold purchased from these parties were accounted in the stock register for standard gold, while the gold seized was seen to have been released from the stock register for refined gold. However there was no transfer of gold from the stock register for standard gold to that of refined gold. There was also no gold sourced from outside as entered in the stock register for refined gold. This totally demolish the contention of the appellants that the gold seized was that purchased at Mumbai. The registers produced and the transactions alleged did not tally nor did the quantity seized and that seen from the alleged Travel Authorisation Vouchers. The records maintained were vague, incomplete and incorrect justifying the allegation of the Department that they were fabricated. The transactions were shrouded in mystery and were not transparent and exact, especially considering the business of precious metal. The appellants hence clearly failed to discharge the onus of proof cast on them by Section 123. 22. Taking the totality of the evidence analyzed by the Department, as produced by the appellants themselves and the attendant circumstances resulting in the seizure, we find that the Tribunal was not justified in upsetting the findings of the first appellate authority, and therefore, the appeals are allowed, and the impugned order is set aside and the order of the first appellate authority is restored. No order as to costs. Sd/- K.VINOD CHANDRAN JUDGE Sd/- ASHOK MENON dkr JUDGE","The Kerala High Court delivered a judgment on March 1, 2019, regarding a batch of Customs Appeals filed by the Commissioner of Customs, Cochin, against Om Prakash Khatri and others, related to the seizure of gold. The appeals challenged the decision of the CESTAT, which had set aside the confiscation of gold and penalties. The case stemmed from the 2014 seizure of approximately 9.9 kg of unmarked gold and gold ornaments from two employees of M/s Panna Gold Impex Ltd. The High Court focused on the interpretation of Section 123 of the Customs Act, 1962, which deals with the burden of proof. The Court held that since gold is a specified item under Section 123, the onus of proving that the gold was legally acquired and not smuggled falls squarely on the person from whose custody it was seized, or in this case, the company director, Om Prakash Khatri, who accepted ownership. This ruling directly contradicted the Tribunal's finding that the Department had to prove the gold was smuggled. The Court upheld that the initial seizure was justified by a reasonable belief of smuggling, fortified by the fact that the carriers gave inculpatory statements under Section 108 of the Act, admitting the gold was smuggled and that they avoided standard transport methods. Furthermore, the court found the Company's defense unreliable, pointing out that their stock registers and purchase documents were vague, incomplete, and did not tally with the seized quantity. Finding that the respondents failed to discharge the heavy burden of proof cast upon them, the High Court set aside the Tribunal’s order and restored the order of the first appellate authority, confirming the confiscation of the gold and the imposed penalties."

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement effective as of the date and year first written above. For CodeGenius Technologies Private Limited (Signature of Authorized Signatory) Name: Ms. Aarti Desai Designation: Head Human Resources For Employee (Signature) Name: Rohan Varma Date: 1st November, 2024","This employment agreement, effective November 1, 2024, appoints Mr. Rohan Varma as a Permanent Full-Time Senior Software Engineer at CodeGenius Technologies Private Limited, a software development and IT services company located in Bengaluru, which also holds exclusive jurisdiction over disputes. The contract establishes an indefinite term of employment beginning with a six (6) month probationary period. During this probation, the Company holds the right to terminate employment with only fifteen (15) days' written notice or payment in lieu thereof, without needing to assign a reason. Upon satisfactory confirmation, the employment continues. Mr. Varma's annual Cost to Company (CTC) is set at INR 15,00,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakh), payable monthly, which includes retiral benefits like PF and Gratuity. Annual increments and bonuses are stated to be at the Company's sole discretion based on performance review. Post-confirmation, termination by either the Employee or the Employer requires Sixty (60) days' prior written notice. The Company, however, retains the right to terminate immediately for cause, such as misconduct, fraud, or gross negligence, without notice or payment. The Employee's work location is primarily Bengaluru, but the Company reserves the right to transfer the employee anywhere in India or abroad. Furthermore, the agreement includes a strong Intellectual Property clause, stating that all inventions, software, and IP created by the employee during employment shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Disputes are primarily subject to the courts in Bengaluru, though the Company holds the option to refer any dispute to arbitration in Bengaluru."
"If at any time, any question, dispute or difference whatsoever shall arise between the owner and the contractor, ""upon or in relation to or connection with this contractor"" either party, may forthwith give to the other notice in writing of the existence of such question, dispute or difference and the same shall be referred to the adjudication of ........ arbitrator. (ii) The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and procedure under Indian Arbitration Act, 1940 or any statutory modifications thereof ... ... Clause 74 speaks that the contract shall be in accordance to and ""subject to the laws of India"" ..... ... Therefore, it is clear that the language in Clause 73 is no longer res integra. It is of very wide. Any question, any dispute or any difference whatsoever arisen between the parties in relation to the contract shall be referable for adjudication by an arbitrator which shall be adjudicated in accordance with the provisions of the predecessor Arbitration Act, 1940 or its successor, under the Act. The laws in force in India including the Contract Act shall apply to the dispute, difference or any question arisen for adjudication before the arbitration tribunal. It would, therefore, be clear that merely because the finding was recorded that the employer did not commit breach of the contract does not per force prevent the claimant to raise dispute of his entitlement to compensation for loss suffered in execution of the contract. In fact, though Section 73 of the Contract Act is not attracted to the facts in this case, Section 70 of the Contract Act stands attracted and be applied to the disputes or difference arisen between the claimant and the employer. The contract was admittedly, extended five times and the work came to be executed and possession thereof was delivered within the extended period of contract. As was found earlier, contract provides for its determination, on breach committed by the claimant, have it executed through other agency and also claim liquidated damages for its breach from the claimant. Rightly the employer did not take recourse to that power. On the other hand, the employer extended the period of contract volitiously in the first instance and later at the request of the claimant. In that behalf it is relevant to read Section 70 of the Contract Act which reads as under : ""Where a person lawfully does anything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitiously, and such other person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect of, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered."" 71. Section 70 enables a person who lawfully renders service or delivers a thing or does anything not intending to do so gratuitiously, to claim compensation from the person who enjoys the benefit of the services rendered, work done or delivered anything. In equity the person who enjoys the benefit is to compensate the former in respect of the work done, service rendered or thing delivered, even though no express agreement or a contract is proved. In Mulla's Contract Act - Eleventh Edition revised by R.K. Abichandani, Page 754, it is stated thus ""Voluntary acceptance of the benefit of the work done or the thing delivered is the foundation of the claim under Section 70. If once the benefit of the work done or thing delivered is accepted, it can be presumed that the said work was done or thing was delivered without any intention to do so gratuitously. Similarly, it can as well be presumed that the person who has accepted the work done or thing delivered has enjoyed the benefit also. Section 70 deals with cases where there is no valid contract. However, it is possible to infer from the circumstances of a given case that a lawful relationship is born between the two and such a relationship is recognized under the provisions of Section 70."" 27. In the light of the aforesaid reasoning given by the Arbitrator, if we now look into the provision of Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act along with Section 73 thereof, we are left with no doubt in our mind that the reasoning given by the Arbitrator particularly that of invoking Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act for allowing of the few claims raised by respondent No.1 / Contractor to be proper, legal and justified. Section 73 of the Indian Contract Act at the outset disentitles the contractor any amount of compensation for the simple reason that the Arbitrator has reached to a categorical and emphatic finding of fact that there has been no breach of contract on the part of the appellant- Corporation. Nonetheless, the reasons reflected in paragraphs Nos.66, 70 and 71 (supra), would also show that because of certain supplementary agreement certain extra works were also asked to be executed by the respondent No.1/ Contractor. The appellant- Corporation had themselves repeatedly on five occasions granted extension of time, not once have the appellant-Corporation raised its objection on the respondent No.1 / Contractor seeking extension of time. Likewise, not even once had the appellant-Corporation extended time for completion of work invoking the relevant clause for liquidating the damages. 28. It is in this context that the relevance of Section 70 of the Indian Contract Act becomes germane and relevant to the claim put forth by the respondent No.1 / Contractor. Admittedly, the respondent No.1 / Contractor had lawfully","This document is a formal Affidavit (sworn declaration) executed jointly by two parents, Sri Anil Kumar Basu and Smt Mousumi Basu, on December 15, 2023, in Kolkata, West Bengal.

The loan is explicitly Secured Against Mortgage of Property, requiring the Borrower to create a First Mortgage (Equitable or Registered) over the specified immovable asset, Flat No. 501, Crystal Residency, Gurgaon, designated as the Secured Property. The agreement imposes strict Covenants on the Borrower to protect the collateral: the Secured Property must remain free from all encumbrances and the Borrower must not create any further charge or part with possession without the Lender’s prior written consent. The Borrower also commits to maintaining the property in good condition and avoiding structural alterations that could diminish its market value. A key requirement is the Insurance clause, which mandates the Borrower must insure the Secured Property against risks like fire and natural calamities for its full market value, with the policy taken in the joint names of the Borrower and the Lender, noting the Lender’s interest. If the Borrower fails to insure, the Lender may do so, and the incurred costs are immediately added to the Loan outstanding. The Default clause provides the Lender with powerful remedies: if the Borrower defaults on repayment or breaches any term, the Lender gains the right to Recall the entire Loan with immediate effect and enforce its rights under the mortgage, including taking possession or causing the sale of the Secured Property as per law. All associated stamp duty, registration charges, and legal costs for the agreement and the mortgage deed are the sole responsibility of the Borrower. The agreement is governed by the laws of India, with exclusive jurisdiction vested in the courts of Gurgaon, Haryana."

"Himachal Pradesh High Court Sh. Shankar Dass vs Himachal Pradesh State Electricity ... on 25 October, 2021 Author: Ajay Mohan Goel Bench: Ajay Mohan Goel IN THE HIGH COURT OF HIMACHAL PRADESH, SHIMLA ON THE 25th DAY OF OCTOBER, 2021 BEFORE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY MOHAN GOEL CIVIL ORIGINAL PETITION CONTEMPT (TRIBUNAL) No.176 of 2020 Between: SANJEEV KUMAR S/O LATE SH. SHANKAR DASS, VILLAGE -SAKON, P.O.- BALH, TEHSIL BANGANA, DISTRICT-UNA, H.P. 174321. ....PETITIONER. (BY. SHRI ANKUSH DASS SOOD, SENIOR ADVOCATE WITH SHRI RAKESH K. SHARMA, ADVOCATE) AND 1. KUMUD SINGH D/O SH. SHAKTI SINGH, SECRETARY OF HIMACHAL PRADESH STATE ELECTRICITY BOARD VIDYUT BHAVAN SHIMLA. 2. DR. ASHWANI SHARMA, SECRETARY-CUM- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HPSEBL (IN TERMS OF ORDER DATED 21/7/2020) 3. MANOJ KUMAR, SECRETARY OF RESPONDENT-BOARD (IN TERMS OF ORDER DATED 5/10/2021) ....RESPONDENTS. (BY. SHRI SURINDER SAKLANI, ADVOCATE ) JUDGMENT The petitioner before this Court was appointed as a Junior Engineer (Electrical) with the H.P. State Electricity Board pursuant to Office Order dated 05.08.2011 on contract basis. He approached the learned erstwhile Himachal Pradesh Administrative Tribunal by way of O.A. No.4735 of 2015, titled as Sanjeev Kumar Vs. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board & others, vide which Original Application, prayer was made that the employer be directed to offer appointment to him from the date of initial appointment on regular basis in terms of similar treatment having been granted to the incumbents similarly situated as the petitioner who stood appointed in these posts under the 3% quota meant for Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, 1995. This Original Application was disposed of by the learned Tribunal in the following terms:- 4. The learned counsel for the applicant states at the very outset that the case of the applicant is squarely covered under common judgment 30.10.2014, Annexure A-3, rendered by the Hon'ble High Court of Himachal Pradesh in CWP No.811 of 2011, Ashwani Kumar Versus Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board & others and the connected matters. 5. the learned Standing Counsel states on behalf of the respondents that subject to verification of records, if it is found that the applicant is similarly situate as the petitioner in the aforesaid CWP No.811 of 2011 and the connected matters, his case shall also be considered accordingly. 6. In view of the above, the original application is disposed of in terms of the aforementioned judgment in CWP No.811 of 2011 and the connected matters, with a direction to the respondents/ competent authority that subject to the above verification and on finding the applicant to be similarly situate as above, benefit of the said judgment, if the same has attained finality and implemented, shall also be extended to him alongwith consequential benefits, if any, as per law, without any discrimination, within three months from the date of production of certified copy of this order by the applicant. 2. As no order was passed by the competent authority within the stipulated period of three months, the petitioner filed this contempt petition before the learned Tribunal which after abolition of the learned Tribunal stands transferred to this Court for the purpose of adjudication. 3. Alongwith the response which was filed to the present contempt petition, an order passed by the competent authority dated 13.06.2017 was also appended, vide which the representation of the petitioner stood dismissed on the ground that as the petitioner was recruited vide a drive in which there were persons of other categories also, i.e. Open Category, Scheduled Caste Category and Scheduled Tribe Category, who were offered appointment on contract basis, therefore, the petitioner was not entitled for the relief as was being prayed by him. 4. Rejoinder to the reply stands filed by the petitioner and it stands mentioned therein, as has also been argued by learned Senior Counsel, that Ashwani Kumar with whom parity was being drawn by the petitioner was similarly situated to the petitioner who was offered regular appointment by the respondent-board in terms of the order passed by the competent authority, appended with the rejoinder, dated 20.06.2015 (Annexure C-7) and the reasons which stand assigned by the competent authority while dismissing the representation of the petitioner are not only perverse but the act of the respondent-authority is also contemptuous and the same amounts to willful disobedience of the Court orders for the reasons that when on the basis of a direction passed by this Court in CWP No.811 of 2011, Ashwani Kumar Versus Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board & others and the connected matters, decided on 30.10.2014, the competent authority regularized the services of an incumbents appointed under 3% reserve backlog posts meant for Person with Disability, then denying the same relief to the petitioner is nothing but contempt. Accordingly, a prayer has been made that appropriate action be taken against the respondents for willful disobedience of the Court orders. 5. Justifying the act of the respondent, Mr. Surinder Saklani, learned counsel for the respondent has argued that though it is not in dispute that both Ashwani Kumar and the petitioner have been appointed under 3% quota under the Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, 1995, however Ashwani Kumar alongwith other incumbents were appointed exclusively under a drive taken by Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board to fill the backlog of vacancies available under the Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, 1995, but this was not the case with the petitioner as he although was recruited under the Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, 1995, but was recruited alongwith other incumbents belonging to General Category as well as Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes Categories. 6. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the pleadings. 7. A perusal of the order which has been passed by the competent authority, dated 13.06.2017, inter alia, demonstrates that the same has not been passed in terms of the judgment passed by the learned Tribunal vide order dated10.12.2015, in O.A. No.4735 of 2015. This Court is making the said observation for the following reasons:- Order dated 10.12.2015 demonstrates that it was contended before the learned Tribunal on behalf of the present petitioner that his case was squarely covered by the common judgment rendered by the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in CWP No.811 of 2011, Ashwani Kumar Versus Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board & others and connected matters, decided on 30.10.2014. Thereafter, a holding out was made by the learned Standing Counsel for the Board before the learned Tribunal that subject to verification of records, if it was found that the applicant was indeed similarly situated as the petitioner in CWP No.811 of 2011 and other connected matters, his case shall be considered accordingly. It was in this backdrop that the learned Tribunal disposed of the Original Application by passing a direction that respondent/competent authority subject to the verification of the factum of the petitioner being similarly situated as Ashwani Kumar and on finding the petitioner to be similarly situated, extend the benefit of judgment if the same had attained finality and stood implemented alongwith consequential benefits, if any, as per law without any discrimination. 8. Now, incidently order dated 13.06.2017 has not dealt with the said directions passed by the learned Tribunal in letter and spirit. It appears that what weighed with the appropriate authority was more the mode of recruitment of the petitioner rather than his contention that as he stood recruited under 3% quota prescribed under the Persons with Disability (PWD) Act, 1995, as was Ashwani Kumar, therefore, he being similarly situated was entitled for similar relief as stood granted to Ashwani Kumar and that too by the Board itself by its decision dated 20.06.2015 (Annexure C-7), appended with the rejoinder. 9. To this effect, this Court is of the considered view that order dated 13.06.2017 suffers from infirmity as the same is not inconsonance with the directions issued by the learned Tribunal. It is thus but obvious that in view of the said observations made by the Court, order dated 13.06.2017 does not with stands the test of legality as it is not inconsonance with the directions passed by the learned Tribunal. 10. Now, in this background, the moot issue is as to what directions can be passed in the present Contempt Petition in order to ensure that substantive justice is imparted to the parties. 11. Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in AIR 1970 Supreme Court 1767, titled The Aligarh Municipal Board and others Versus Ekka Tonga Mazdoor Union and others has been pleased to hold that the contempt proceedings against a person who has failed to comply with the Court's order serves a dual purpose: (a) Vindication of the public interest by punishment of contemptuous conduct and (b) coercion to compel the contemner to do what the law required of him. 12. Accordingly, in order to impart substantive justice to the parties, this Contempt Petition is ordered to be closed by discharging the notice but with a direction that fresh order be passed by the authority concerned on the representation of the petitioner in terms of directions passed by the learned Tribunal in O.A. No.4735 of 2015, titled as Sanjeev Kumar Vs. Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board & others, dated 10.12.2015, with specific reference to the judgment of Ashwani Kumar as well as per the decision taken by the Board of Directors as is reflected in publication dated 20.06.2015 appended with the rejoinder as Annexure C-7. 13. Now, needful shall be done by the competent authority on or before 30.11.2021 after giving an opportunity of being heard to the petitioner. October 25, 2021 (Ajay Mohan Goel) (rishi) Judge","The Himachal Pradesh High Court (Justice Ajay Mohan Goel) delivered a judgment on October 25, 2021, in a Contempt Petition filed by Sanjeev Kumar against the Himachal Pradesh State Electricity Board (HPSEBL). The petitioner, a Junior Engineer appointed on a contract basis, sought compliance with an earlier direction from the erstwhile Administrative Tribunal. The original case, disposed of by the Tribunal on December 10, 2015, had directed the HPSEBL to consider the petitioner's case for regularization if he was found to be similarly situated to another employee, Ashwani Kumar, whose regularization had been ordered by the High Court in a previous judgment (CWP No. 811 of 2011). Both the petitioner and Ashwani Kumar had been appointed under the 3% quota reserved for Persons with Disability (PWD). Since the HPSEBL failed to comply within the stipulated time, the petitioner filed the contempt petition. In response, the Board produced an order dated June 13, 2017, dismissing the petitioner's representation. The Board argued that the petitioner was recruited in a drive that included General, SC, and ST categories, while Ashwani Kumar was part of an exclusive drive to clear the PWD backlog, making them dissimilarly situated. The petitioner countered that Ashwani Kumar was in fact regularized by the Board itself in 2015, and the grounds for denying relief to the petitioner were perverse and contemptuous. The High Court found the Board's order of June 13, 2017, to be infirm and not in consonance with the specific directions of the Tribunal. The Court observed that the Board focused on the mode of recruitment rather than the core contention: that both employees were recruited under the same PWD quota and one was already regularized by the Board. Stating that contempt proceedings serve to compel compliance and vindicate public interest, the Court chose not to punish the respondents immediately. Instead, the Court closed the contempt proceedings by discharging the notice but issued a clear, coercive direction: the competent authority must pass a fresh order on the petitioner's representation by November 30, 2021, specifically considering the judgment of Ashwani Kumar and the Board's own 2015 decision to regularize him, after granting the petitioner a hearing opportunity."

On going through the rival contentions, based on the substantial evidence available on record, the following points would arise for determination: 1) Whether the complainant proves beyond all reasonable doubt that towards discharge of legally recoverable debt or liability, the accused have issued Ex.P1 - cheque in his favour and the same came to be dishonoured for the reasons 'Account blocked situation covered in 2125' and even after service of notice, the accused have failed to repay the cheque amount and thereby accused Nos.1 and 2 have committed an offence punishable under Section 138 of N.I.Act? 2) What Order? 9. On appreciation of materials available on record, my findings on the above points are as under: Point No.1 : In the Negative Point No.2 : As per final order, for the following: REASONS 10. POINT No.1: The complainant has filed this complaint for an offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act against the accused Nos.1 and 2 and prayed to punish the accused Nos.1 and 2 for an offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. 11. To attract Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, complainant should prove that; (1) the accused have issued a cheque for discharge of legally recoverable debt. (2) The same was presented through his banker. (3) It was dishonoured on presentation. (4) The notice in terms of provisions was served on the accused and (5) Despite service of notice neither any payment was made nor other obligations, if any were complied within 15 days from the date of receipt of notice. 12. In order to prove his case, the complainant filed his affidavit and himself examined as PW.1, wherein, he has reiterated the averments made in the complaint. In support of his contention, he relied upon the documents at Exs.P1 to P26. Among them, cheque bearing No.698952 issued by the accused for sum of Rs.10,00,000/- dated 19.06.2020, drawn on Andhra Bank, Jambusavari Dinne Branch, Bengaluru is marked as Ex.P1. The signature of accused No.2 is marked as Ex.P1(a). Ex.P2 is the Bank Endorsement issued by Canara Bank, the contents of Ex.P2 disclose that the cheque bearing No.698952 drawn for Rs.10,00,000/- was dishonoured for the reasons ""Account blocked situation covered in 2125"". Ex.P3 is the Legal Notice dated 07.08.2020, the recitals of Ex.P3 disclose that the complainant has issued this notice to the accused through his counsel. By issuing this notice, complainant called upon the accused to repay the cheque amount of Rs.10,00,000/- within 15 days from the date of receipt of notice. Exs.P4 and P5 are the Postal receipts. Exs.P6 and P7 are the postal acknowledgment cards. Ex.P8 is the bank challan counter foil. Ex.P9 is the bank passbook. Ex.P10 is the police complaint. Ex.P11 is the statement given by complainant before the C.K.Achukattu Police Station. Ex.P12 is the acknowledgment dated 20.07.2020 issued by C.K.Achukattu police. Exs.P13 and P14 are the rent agreements. Ex.P15 is the Deed of Agreement dated 09.07.2017 executed by accused in favour of complainant. Exs.P16 to P19 are the RTC Extracts. Exs.P21 and P22 are the electricity bills. Ex.P23 is the Aadhaar Card. Ex.P24 is the CD. Ex.P25 is the copy of RC Card and Ex.P26 is the certified copy of private complaint in C.C.No.2409 of 2021 on the file of learned XVI ACMM Court, Bengaluru. The PW.1 was subjected to the cross- examination by the advocate for the accused. Section 118 (a) of Negotiable Instruments Act provides that: ""Until the contrary is proved, the following presumptions shall be made: (a) of consideration; that every negotiable instrument was made or drawn for consideration and that every such instrument, when it has been accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred, was accepted, indorsed, negotiated or transferred for consideration."" Section 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act provides that: ""It shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the holder of a cheque received the cheque of the nature referred to in section 138 for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability."" The above presumptions are rebuttable in nature. 13. In order to rebut the presumption available under Sections 118(a) and 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act, the accused has filed his affidavit and examined himself as DW.1. In his evidence, he has stated that he sought loan of Rs.5 lakhs from the complainant in the month of March 2017 and the complainant has transferred an amount of Rs.4,75,000/- to his account on 09.03.2017, he has not borrowed an amount of Rs.10 lakhs from the complainant at any point of time and he has no capacity to lend such huge amount to him, in the month of June 2020, towards security of the above said amount, he gave 3 signed blank cheques to the complainant and after receipt of 3 cheques, the complainant has threatened and demanded him to pay Rs.10 lakhs, hence, he lodged police complaint against the complainant. After obtaining his signature on e-stamp paper, the complainant has created and concocted the loan agreement as per Ex.P15, he did not fill up the contents on the questioned cheque, the instant complaint is barred by limitation, the legal notice sent by complainant was not served on him, he has not received the amount as alleged in complaint from the complainant at any point of time and he has not issued the alleged cheque to the complainant for discharge of legally enforceable debt, hence, he prayed for acquit him. In support of his contention, he relied upon the documents at Exs.D1 and D2. Among them, Ex.D1 is the copy of legal notice dated 02.08.2021 issued by complainant herein through his counsel to one Ganesha Sastry and Ex.D2 is the Aadhaar Card pertaining to accused. The DW.1 was subjected to the cross-examination by the advocate for the complainant. 14. The advocate for complainant has argued that the legal notice sent by complainant was served on accused as per Exs.P6 and P7. If the accused is not liable to pay the amount covered under Ex.P1-cheque, he would have issued reply notice to the complainant against the statutory notice of complainant. But in this case, the accused has not issued reply notice. Therefore, the accused is liable to pay the cheque amount. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the decisions as under: a) 2021 ACD 32 (JHA) in the case of M/s. Noddy Auto Pvt. Ltd and others V/s. State of Jharkhand and another. b) 2014 ACD 663 (Bom) in the case of Rekha Mahindra Shah V/s. Gautam Umed Parmar and another. c) 2004 (2) DCR 384 in the case of Nirdosh Enterprises, Hyderabad V/s. State of A.P and another. d) 2016 Crl.L.J. 842 in the case of Vijay Kumar Gupta V/s. Pankaj Sharma. e) 2009 (2) DCR 411 in the case of Ashok Kumar Agarwal V/s. State. I have gone through the above decisions. In the above decisions, their lordships observed that sending of legal notice by register post along with under certificate to correct address is sufficient service of notice. In the present case, the complainant has sent the notice by registered post to the correct of address of accused. 15. The address mentioned in the cause title of complaint, the address mentioned in the legal notice and postal acknowledgment cards are all one and the same. Further on perusal of the signatures appear on postal acknowledgment cards, it reveals that the accused has received the legal notice by putting his signature on the postal acknowledgment cards. In order to disprove the service of demand notice, the accused did not try to adduce the evidence of concerned post master, who got issued Exs.P6 and P7. In the absence of such evidence before the court, it is difficult to come to conclusion that the notice was not served on accused. It appears that the complainant has sent the demand notice to the correct address of accused and the same got served on him. Therefore, the accused cannot say that the legal notice was not served on him and he does not aware about the notice sent by the complainant. It is relevant to cite the decision reported in 2006 (4) KCCR 2375 in the case of Mr.Umraz Khan and others V/s. Mr.A.Jameel Ahmed and another, wherein, Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka was pleased to held that: ""Once there is proof of posting of notice to correct address, it is deemed to have been served, the judgment of acquittal is bad in law"". 16. On going through the said dictum, it is also made clear that if the notice was sent with correct address of the accused, it is suffice to draw the inference that the notice was duly served on the accused. If the accused failed to accept the notice and failed to claim the notice sent to him under register post, there is deemed service of notice upon him. In the present case on hand, it appears that the address mentioned in the cause title of complaint, legal notice and postal acknowledgment cards are one and the same. From which, it made clear that the legal notice as required under Section 138(b) of Negotiable Instruments Act was served upon accused and complainant has complied the Section 138(b) of Negotiable Instruments Act. 17. Further the advocate for complainant argued that issuance of blank cheque by putting his signature, it authorized the complainant to fill up the contents on the cheque. In support of his arguments he relied upon the decisions are as under: a) 2010 (1) DCR 336 in the case of Latha K.Nair V/s. Gold Mohar Foods and Feeds Ltd. b) 2013 (1) DCR 98 in the case of Kuppayammal V/s. A.Sitheswaran. c) 2015 ACD 607 (Mad) in the case of S.Ponnusamy alias S.P.Samy V/s. K.Mani. d) 2004 (2) DCR 605 in the case of L.Mohan V/s. V.Mohan Naidu. e) 2013 Kar.L.J 347 in the case of M.D.Ramakrishnaiah V/s. V.Javaregowda. f) 2001 (4) Kar.L.J. 122 in the case of S.R.Muralidar V/s. Ashok.G.Y. g) 2010 (1) DCR 582 in the case of Bank of India, Adiyapur, Jamshedpur V/s. M/s. Aswi Electricals and others. I have gone through the above decisions. In the above decisions, their lordships observed that as per Section 20 of Negotiable Instrument Act where one person signs and delivers to another person a signed blank cheque, then he thereby gives prima-facie authorities to the holder thereon to make it complete. Therefore, in view of the above decisions, accused cannot say that signed blank cheque issued by him to the complainant is not entertained. 18. It is the main defence of accused is that the complainant has transferred only an amount of Rs.4,75,000/- to his account on 09.03.2017 and he has not borrowed an amount of Rs.10 lakhs from the complainant at any point of time, in the month of June 2020, towards security of Rs.4,75,000/-, he gave 3 signed blank cheques and one signed blank e-stamp paper and he has not issued the alleged cheque to the complainant for discharge of legally enforceable debt. Further it is defence of accused is that the complainant was not having financial capacity to lend an amount of Rs.10 lakhs to him and he cannot seek time barred debt and Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act does not attract against him, hence, he prayed to acquit him. 19. The advocate for complainant has argued that the complainant was having sufficient funds to lend an amount of Rs.10 lakhs to the accused. As such, he has lent the amount of Rs.10 lakhs to the accused and towards repayment of the said amount, the accused has issued the alleged cheque in favour of complainant and when the said cheque was presented for encashment, the same came to be dishonoured and returned as ""Account blocked situation covered in 2125"". Thereby, the accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. Further argued that when the accused has issued the alleged cheque for repayment of amount, it cannot be said that he has issued the cheque for payment of time barred debt. Even the cheque issued for time barred debt also attracts Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. In support of his arguments, he relied upon decisions as under: a) AIR Online 2021 Kar 937 in the case of Shreeyansh Rayappa Nandeshwar V/s. Prakash Ponde decided on 28.01.2021, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Plea of accused that transaction is time barred, so he cannot be made criminally liable - Same is to be decided after regarding evidence in trial - Hence, proceedings not liable to be quashed."" b) AIR Online 2019 Kar 2165 in the case of S.V.Enterprises V/s. Tulasiram.V decided on 04.12.2019, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Once cheque is proved and same was issued in discharge of any debt - Even if it is time barred, such stand is not available to accused - Offence u/S.138 made out."" c) 2007 Crl.L.J. 1486 :: 2007 (5) AIR Kar R 814 in the case of Ramakrishnan V/s. Gangadharan Nair and another decided on 08.08.2006, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Dishonour of cheque - Legally enforceable debt/liability - Cheque issued for discharge of time barred debt - Would still fall within purview of S. 138 in view of S. 25(3) of Contract Act and S. 46 of N.I. Act."" d) AIR Online 2019 Bom 1159 in the case of M.Shantilal and Co. V/s. Abbaji Maruti Jadhav and another decided on 14.11.2019, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Once a cheque is drawn for discharge of time barred debt it creates a promise which becomes when enforceable contract and therefore, it cannot be said that cheque is drawn in discharge of debt or liability is not legally enforceable - Complaint as per Section 25 (3) of Contract Act is maintainable."" e) 2020 ACD 1 (MAD) in the case of Anbarasu V/s. Mukanchand Bothra (deceased) decided on 24.07.2019, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Cheque not issued towards time barred debt but for live debt - Prosecution under S. 138 proper."" I have gone through the above decisions. 20. On the other hand the learned counsel for accused has argued that the time barred debt is not legally enforceable debt and complainant cannot seek relief under Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the decisions as under: a) Crl.A.No.545/2010 in the case of K.V.Subba Reddy V/s. N.Raghava Reddy decided on 28.02.2014, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act is attracted only legally recoverable debt and it cannot be said that time barred debt is legally recoverable debt."" b) Crl.A.No.200057/2010 in the case of The Bidar Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd. V/s. Girish decided on 17.12.2020, wherein the Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka held in Para No.37 that: ""Further as per Section 13 of N.I Act ""negotiable instrument"" means a ""promissory note"" ""bill of exchange"", or ""cheque"" payable either to order or to bearer. The definition of promissory note as stated in section 4 of the N.I Act indicates that, it contains an unconditional undertaking signed by the maker, to pay a sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person, or to the bearer of instrument. The definition of ""bill of exchange"" as stated in Section 5 and the definition of cheque contain only an unconditional order which clearly distinguish them from the definition of promissory note. In promissory note there must be an express undertaking upon the face of instrument to pay the money. Therefore in promissory there is unconditional undertaking i.e., promise to pay, but the definition of bill of exchange and cheque contain only an unconditional order. This distinction needs to be kept in mind while considering whether the cheque itself constitutes a promise in writing by the accused so as to bring that cheque within the ambit of section 25 (3) of the Indian Contract Act 1872 and penal provision under section 138 of N.I Act."" In para No.39 observed that: In view of the principles stated in the above referred decision and discussion it is evident that the penal provision of Section 138 of the N.I.Act is applicable only to the cheques which are issued for the discharge in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, which according to explanation must be a legally enforceable debt or other liability. A cheque given in discharge of a time barred debt will not constitute an unconditional undertaking or promise in writing either expressly or impliedly so as to attract the criminal offence under Section 138 of N.I Act. This was elaborated in Sasseriyil Josesph's case (supra) which is affirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court as stated above. A cheque given in discharge of a time barred debt will not constitute a promise in writing not even an implied promise so as to attract a criminal liability under Section 138 of N.I Act. c) 2001 Crl.L.J.24 in the case of Sasseriyil Joseph V/s. Devassia, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Cheque in question was issued in discharge of time barred debt - No valid acknowledgment of debt before expiry of 3 years from the date of loan - Accused cannot be convicted for dishonour of cheque."" The said judgment was challenged before the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave to Appeal (Crl.) No.1785/2001 by Hon'ble Supreme Court by judgment dated 10.09.2021 affirmed the said view of Hon'ble Kerala High Court. d) (2006) 6 SCC 39 in the case of M.S.Narayana Menon Alias Mani V/s. State of Kerala and another, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Initially burden of proof on accused to rebut the said presumption by raising a probable defence. If he discharges the said burden the onus thereafter shifts on the complainant to prove his case. Accused can discharge its burden on the basis of preponderance of probabilities."" e) Crl.R.P.No.1571/2010 in the case of Shivamurthy V/s. Amruthraj, wherein, it was pleased to held that: ""Mere issuance of cheque itself would not be sufficient unless it is shown that the said cheque was issued towards discharge of legally recoverable debt."" f) Crl.A.No.636/2019 in the case of Basalingappa V/s. Mudibasappa decided on 09.04.2019, wherein, it was pleased to held that: Accused cannot be expected to discharge an unduly high standard of proof and further observed that complainant should prove his financial capacity. g) Crl.A.No.473 of 2019(A) in the case of Purandara Rai V/s. Naveendra Naik it is decided on 10.02.2021, wherein, it was pleased to held that: In para No.5: ""It is an admitted fact that as per the oral evidence given by the complainant before the trial Court, it was a time barred debt. Ex.P6 is the receipt dated 22.06.2009, which is executed by the accused- respondent in favour of the complainant for having borrowed a loan of Rs.90,000/- for his family necessities, but according to the complainant cheque was issued on 05.01.2013, which is beyond the period of three years. Under these circumstances, the trial Court has rightly come to the conclusion that it was a time barred debt and the cheque issued for clearance of the time barred debt cannot be entertained."" 21. While cross-examining the PW.1, the accused has partly admitted the case of the complainant. Herein it is necessary to see that whether the said transaction held between complainant and accused is legally enforceable liability within the provisions of Limitation Act to consider legally enforceable debt. Article 21 of the Indian Limitation Act provides that the period of limitation for recovery of loan starts from the date on which the amount has been paid. The Section 18 of Limitation Act provides that the fresh period of limitation shall be computed if any acknowledgment of debt has been executed by the borrower within the prescribed period of limitation i.e., within 3 years from the date of borrowing of loan. Further Section 19 of Limitation Act provides that a fresh period of limitation shall be computed from the date of payment of some money towards loan in question. As per the averments of the complainant, the amount has been given by the complainant to the accused on 09.03.2017 and towards discharge of his liability, the accused has issued cheque on 19.06.2020. The period for recovery of the said amount ends in the month of March 2020. Therefore, the facts and circumstance of this case clearly goes to show that the dishonour of cheque was issued to discharge time barred debt. 22. In the recent judgments of Hon'ble High Court of Karnataka in the case of The Bidar Urban Co-operative Bank Ltd. V/s. Girish and in the case of Purandara Rai V/s. Naveendra Naik as stated above held that the penal provision of Section 138 of the N.I.Act is applicable only to the cheques which are issued for the discharge in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability, which according to explanation must be a legally enforceable debt or other liability. A cheque given in discharge of a time barred debt will not constitute an unconditional undertaking or promise in writing either expressly or impliedly so as to attract the criminal offence under Section 138 of N.I Act. Cheque issued for clearance of time barred debt cannot be entertained. 23. In the present case on hand, the disputed cheque was presented for time barred debt and it came to be dishonoured. The complaint averments and the materials produced on behalf of the complainant goes to show that the alleged loan amount has been given by the complainant to the accused on 09.03.2017 and towards discharge of his liability, the accused has issued questioned questioned cheque on 19.06.2020. The period for recovery of the said amount ends in the month of March 2020. The complainant kept silent for about 3 years 3 months and 10 days without seeking the recovery of the loan amount from the accused. More so, on the date of issuance of Ex.P1-cheque on 19.06.2020, the debt mentioned in the complaint became time barred and the cheque in question has not been issued in respect of legally enforceable debt or other liability for the purpose of involving Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, Section 138 of Negotiable Instrument Act does not attract against the accused. Thus, the accused has rebutted the presumption available under Sections 118(a) and 139 of Negotiable Instruments Act. Therefore, as discussed above, the complainant has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused Nos.1 and 2 for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act beyond all reasonable doubt. Hence, in view of the above said reasons, I hold point No.1 in the Negative. 24. Point No.2: In view of my findings on point No.1, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER Acting under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C the accused Nos.1 and 2 are acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The bail bond and cash security/surety bond of the accused stands cancelled.

Judgment pronounced in the open court vide separate order. ***** ORDER Acting under Section 255(1) of Cr.P.C the accused Nos.1 and 2 are acquitted for the offence punishable under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. The bail bond and cash security/surety bond of the accused stands cancelled. XXIII Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bengaluru.","The Bangalore District Court (XXIII Addl. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate) delivered a judgment on January 30, 2023, in a criminal case filed by Manjunatha.H against M/s. Focus Entertainment and its proprietor, Vinay.S, under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act (cheque dishonour). The accused were acquitted. The complainant alleged that in March 2017, he lent the accused Rs. 10 Lakhs (Rs. 5,25,000/- cash and Rs. 4,75,000/- RTGS) for TV serial production. Toward repaying this liability, the accused issued a cheque for Rs. 10 Lakhs dated June 19, 2020, which was subsequently dishonoured with the remark ""Account Blocked situation covered in 2125"". The accused admitted receiving an RTGS transfer of Rs. 4,75,000/- but denied borrowing Rs. 10 Lakhs. Crucially, the accused contended that the cheque was a signed blank security cheque issued in June 2020. The primary defense was that the alleged debt was time-barred and therefore not a ""legally enforceable debt"" under Section 138 of the N.I. Act. The Court upheld the preliminary requirements of Section 138, including the validity of a signed blank cheque and the deemed service of the legal notice. However, in determining the legally enforceable debt, the Court noted the loan was advanced on March 9, 2017. According to the Limitation Act, 1963, the period for recovering the loan expired in March 2020 (three years from the date of loan). Since the cheque was issued on June 19, 2020 (after the limitation period), the debt was deemed time-barred. Citing precedents from the Karnataka High Court, the Court ruled that the penal provision of Section 138 of the N.I. Act is applicable only to a legally enforceable debt or liability. A cheque issued to discharge a time-barred debt will not attract criminal liability under Section 138. Consequently, the accused successfully rebutted the statutory presumption, leading to their acquittal."
